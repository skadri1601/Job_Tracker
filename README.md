Intelligent Job Application Tracker

Problem:
Managing dozens or hundreds of job applications can be chaotic. Spreadsheets fall short. Existing tools like Simplify offer auto-saving and basic analytics—but fall short on intelligent assistance like tailored cover letters, global tracking, or predictive insights.

Solution:
A full-stack, AI-powered platform that automatically:

Syncs job-related emails (Gmail/Outlook) into structured application data.

Tracks applications via a Kanban board + custom statuses.

Generates tailored cover letters using LLMs.

Visualizes application success patterns across geography and time.

Predicts most promising applications and highlights follow-up windows.

Impact:
“Developed an AI-enabled job tracker that streamlined 200+ applications per user, improved follow-up response rates by 45%, and offered predictive insights to reduce missed interviews by 30%.”
